	<h3>'(Lisp, the language of the '(past future))</h3><br>
	<p>Lisp is a programming language that originated in the 60s, being one of the first high-level languages still in use, following Fortran. The defining feature of this language is its syntax filled with parentheses, stemming from its origins as a calculus language implementing the ideas of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. Lisp also pioneered several areas of computer science, such as tree-based data structures, garbage collection, dynamic types, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, self-hosting compilers, and the REPL.</p>
